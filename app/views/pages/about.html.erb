        catch it, my name is Brian, I live in Arizona, and I build beautiful websites, front to back. Along with being a
        coding wizard who turns patience into software, I’m a kickass father and husband, I’m a life long guitarist, and I
        like being a nice guy too. I also, love love, coffee, yoga, food, meditation, video games, and learning any and all things;
        I’m a huge proponent of using your spare to time to take that extra step and learn something new.
